2.	Multithreading Setup: Develop mechanisms to create and manage multiple threads, distributing computation tasks among them.
3.	Data Partitioning: Design strategies to partition data or workload into smaller chunks that can be processed concurrently by different threads.
4.	Thread Coordination: Implement synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, semaphores) to ensure proper thread coordination and avoid data race conditions.
5.	Performance Measurement: Develop methods to measure and compare the execution time and performance improvement achieved through parallelization.
Solution Approach:
1.	Algorithm Implementation: Choose algorithms like matrix multiplication or sorting and implement their sequential versions as a baseline.
2.	Multithreading Setup: Integrate multithreading libraries (e.g., POSIX threads, Java Threads) to create and manage threads for parallel execution.
