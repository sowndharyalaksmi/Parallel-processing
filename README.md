# Parallel-processing with multithreading
This project holds the content of sorting and matrix multiplication which is implemented in backend with sorting and matrix multiplication algorithms and the data is saved.It uses threads for manipulating values and it gives the apt output. The frontend is developed using the swing. The inputs can be given by the user manually, it gives the output accurately.
